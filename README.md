# 🚀 Java 30-Day LeetCode-Style Daily Challenge Roadmap

Perfect — starting **Day 13**, we switch to a progressive Java + DSA challenge system designed for your exact skill level.

---

## 🌟 Your Profile

* ✔ Aspiring Java developer
* ✔ Strong fundamentals (syntax, loops, arrays, methods)
* ✔ Early OOP understanding (classes, constructors, encapsulation)
* ✔ Beginner-level DS & Algo
* ✔ Wants real interview-style growth

---

# 🚀 How This Daily Challenge System Works

Each day you will receive:

### **1️⃣ A LeetCode-style problem**

Difficulty slowly increases:

* **Easy → Medium → Hard**

Includes:

* Problem statement
* Input / output examples
* Constraints
* Hints **ONLY IF you ask**

---

### **2️⃣ What Concepts You Will Learn**

Each day includes a short explanation of the theory behind the challenge.

---

### **3️⃣ Required Java Topics**

Every challenge lists the Java concepts used:

* Arrays
* Strings
* HashMap / HashSet
* Sliding window
* Two pointers
* OOP
* Recursion
* File I/O (later)

---

### **4️⃣ The 30-Day Progression Roadmap**

Below is your structured plan. You will receive one challenge per day.

* When to optimize an algorithm

---

## **Days 18–22 → HashMap + Sets + Strings**

**Core topics:**

* Counting and frequency logic
* String reconstruction
* Handling duplicates
* Sorting logic
* Unique pattern detection

You will learn:

* How real LeetCode easy/medium string problems are solved

---

## **Days 23–27 → Recursion + OOP**

**Core topics:**

* Basic recursion patterns
* Factorials, combinations, search trees
* Writing your own classes
* Simple simulations

You will learn:

* How to think recursively

---

## **Days 28–30 → File I/O + Mini Project**

**Core topics:**

* Reading from text files
* Writing processed output files
* Mini-project (choose one):

  * Student Grade Tracker
  * Log Analyzer
  * Inventory Manager

You will learn:

* How real applications handle data
